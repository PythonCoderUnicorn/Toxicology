Metabolism, Distribution and Excretion


 
Half-life is a measure of the length of time an agent stays in the body before being
metabolized and eliminated. More precisely, the half-life of an agent refers to the time it
takes to reduce the level of the agent by one half. For example, if the amount of caffeine
in your blood were measured as 12 units (the particular units are not important), it would
take approximately five hours for that level to be reduced to six units. In this case, five
hours represents the half-life of caffeine. Another five hours later the amount would be
reduced in half to three, and so on until it approaches zero. The half-life of an agent,
either toxic or beneficial, is a critical aspect of its ability to produce and maintain an
effect. There can be considerable individual variability in the ability to metabolize an
agent. This variability is reflected in the half-life for that particular individual. Someone
who rapidly metabolizes caffeine (meaning someone for whom caffeine has a short half-
life, say three hours) may want to drink more coffee more rapidly to elevate and maintain
high caffeine blood levels and achieve the desired effect. Others may find that one-cup of
coffee every 3 or 4 hours is adequate. A variety of factors, such as liver disease or even
pregnancy, can decrease the metabolism or excretion of an agent and thus increase the
half-life. During pregnancy, the half-life of caffeine increases to approximately 7 hours,
resulting in higher blood caffeine levels for a longer period of time. While the half-life of
agents such as caffeine and alcohol are relatively short, many of the most serious
environmental toxicants have much longer half-live values. For example, the half-life of
lead is approximately 30 days. Many pesticides and PCBs are also readily stored in the
body and have corresponding long half-live values. Careful consideration of the half-life

of a drug is an important aspect during medical treatment. The half-life of a hypothetical
drug is illustrated in Figure 2.5.

Figure 2.5. A characterization of Half-life
A substance is consumed at time zero (for example, drink a cup of coffee and
we could measure blood caffeine concentrations) and blood samples are
collected at every hour. Concentration of the agent is plotted against time. The
black line represents the half-life when the blood concentration as dropped by
one half its maximum. Thus, in this example, the half-life is 4 hours.
The ability of an agent to get into a specific organ of the body often dictates its effect. For
example, alcohol and caffeine would not be consumed were they not readily distributed
to the brain, where they produce a considerable effect. As already mentioned, lead can be
exchanged for calcium and accumulate in the bone, while many pesticides and PCBs are
stored in fat cells. These patterns of distribution and the storage of compounds in the
body can have serious toxicological implications. During rapid weight loss, excess
toxicants can be redistributed into the blood supply as fat is metabolized. Lead in the

bone can also be mobilized if there is heavy demand for calcium, as occurs during
pregnancy. To further complicate matters, each area of the body —in this case the fat and
bone—can have its own half-life that can differ from that of blood. The half-life of lead
in the blood is measured in days, while that in bone is measured in years.
Sensitivity, Susceptibility and Variability
Susceptibility refers to the differences in sensitivity to toxic agents, causing some people
to suffer greater effects than others from the same exposure. This is a key concept in
toxicology and risk analysis/management. Susceptibility is primarily related to several
factors, including age, sex, health, and genetic background. Sensitivity is related to
susceptibility but generally refers to special cases of extreme susceptibility to certain
agents by some people. Someone who is allergic to bee stings can have a fatal reaction
when stung by just one bee, while for most others a sting is of little concern. Enhanced
sensitivity to a compound can develop after repeated exposure to it or a similar agent.
Allergies to animals such as cats and dogs are examples of specific sensitivities to an
agent called animal dander. Other individuals may develop a sensitivity to dust mites.
In general, the young and elderly are most susceptible to the adverse effects of an agent.
The young, particularly the very young, are more susceptible because the organs are still
rapidly developing, and dividing cells are more easily harmed than mature cells. For
example, lead affects the developing nervous system to a much greater degree than the
adult brain. The brain is rapidly growing during and after birth, particularly throughout
the first 7 years of life. The brain is not fully developed until the late teens. During the
first year of life the metabolism of agents by the liver is also reduced. This is why the
half-life of caffeine can be measured in days for the newborn while it is hours for the
adult. The elderly are more sensitive to agents because of decreased ability to metabolize
them and decreased ability to compensate for the effects.
Gender can also play an important role in susceptibility to agents, in part due to hormonal
influences. The classic example is the female birth control pill. In this case, a very small
exposure to specific hormones has a very large influence on fertility. Other agents such as
PCBs also appear to affect some of the female hormones. Some athletes use hormones
called steroids to increase muscle mass. These agents have different toxic side effects for
males and females. Females have additional issues related to pregnancy. Pregnancy
causes many changes in physiology that can alter the absorption, distribution, and
metabolism of an agent and thus dramatically influence its effects. For example, during
pregnancy there is a decrease in liver metabolism that increases the half-life of caffeine.
This means that a pregnant woman will maintain higher blood caffeine levels for a longer
period of time than when not pregnant, resulting in increased caffeine exposure to the
developing infant. Agents stored in the fat, such as pesticides and PCBs can be mobilized
during lactation and thus passed on to a nursing infant. Calcitum mobilization during
pregnancy can also redistribute lead from the bone if there has been previous lead
exposure.

Personal health is another factor that can influence susceptibility to an agent. A
compromised liver or immune system can make exposure to even low levels of an agent
completely intolerable. Someone who is diabetic may find sugar toxic and may enjoy
considerable benefit from artificial sweeteners. On the other hand, someone who cannot
metabolize phenylalanine, a naturally occurring and essential substance, may find the
common artificial sweetener in some soda toxic. An individual who suffers from asthma
may find exposure to wood smoke extremely harmful, whereas many people can tolerate
short exposures to it fairly well. (Wood smoke is nevertheless toxic in either case, and
chronic exposure can lead to health problems.) The physiological changes of disease or
chronic illness are thus very important considerations in assessing the exposure to an
agent.
Finally, our genetic variability may make us more or less prone to disease or the effects
of a toxic agent. Some can tolerate caffeine before bed, while for others such exposure
would result in a restless night. It is always important to consider the individual and the
individual characteristics of a situation.
Applying the Principles

Multiple Chemical Exposure
In the real world, we are not exposed to only one chemical at a time. The air we breathe
contains many separate chemicals. Indoor air in homes can contain chemicals from
smoke, molds, carpet glue, mothballs, and cleaning products, to name only a few.
Determining the risk from such multiple exposures is difficult because the body does not
necessarily respond to each chemical in the mixture in the same way it would if the others
were not present. Sometimes one chemical can cause the body to respond more strongly
to another chemical generating a synergistic effect. We know, for example, that exposure
to environmental tobacco smoke greatly increases the risk of cancer from asbestos. The
increase is not additive — that 1s, it 1s not equal to the risk from tobacco plus the risk from
asbestos — but is actually much greater than the sum of the two risks.
There are also cases where exposure to two chemicals reduces toxic effects. Methanol
(wood alcohol) causes blindness if ingested. Methanol poisoning is treated by
administering ethanol (common alcohol), which competes for metabolism in the body,
thus slowing the formation of toxic byproducts of methanol and keeping their levels low
enough to avoid damage to the optic system. This is sometimes referred to as an
antagonistic effect.
When more than two chemicals are involved, the problem of determining risks becomes
increasingly complex. Scientific study of chemical mixtures has been relatively limited
because of the sheer number of combinations possible. Even if the exact effects of

File: Chapter 2 Principles Tox.ED3.10.20.19.docx — Date: 10/25/2019 — Page 20 of 24

exposure to mixtures are unknown, reducing exposure is still a good strategy to lower
risk.
Multiple Chemical Sensitivity
Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is characterized by a variety of adverse effects upon
multiple organs that result from exposure to levels of common foods, drugs, and
chemicals that do not affect most people. Symptoms include headaches, fatigue, lack of
concentration, memory loss, asthma and other often subjective responses following
exposure. MCS has remained controversial because standard medical evaluations, such as
blood biochemical screens, have failed to identify consistent physical or laboratory test
abnormalities that would account for the symptoms.
MCS is thought to develop following sensitization to one chemical, a sensitivity that then
is generalized so that chemicals of a similar class and lower concentrations of exposure
come to elicit the response. Researchers have been working to develop a mechanism of
action for these responses and have focused on the immune system responses and, more
recently, on involvement of the nervous system. Others investigators, while respecting
the symptomatology, postulate that the responses are due to some form of psychological
illnesses. Whatever the mechanism of action, it 1s important to attempt to associate cause
and effect relationships and apply the principles of toxicology. Identification of what
agents may be causing the symptoms can result in plans to reduce exposure to these
agents and thus reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life. In addition, reductions
in the exposure to toxic chemicals for all persons may help reduce the incidence of MCS.
Assessing and Managing Risk

As we have seen, risk is closely related to hazard and is defined as the probability of the
recognized hazard occurring. Risk assessment 1s the process by which the nature and
magnitude of risk are identified, while risk management 1s the process of determining
whether or how much to reduce risk through our actions. Evaluation of the potential
adverse effects of some activity or exposure (risk assessment) is something we all do
informally on a day-to-day basis. What we decide to do is in part the result of an ongoing
risk management decision. It can be as simple as crossing the street against a red light or
as complex as spending the extra money for organically grown foods to reduce our
exposure to pesticides. Many of the risks associated with chemical exposure are indirect
or subtle effects on health; in other words, conditions, situations, or exposures to an agent
that affect the quality of life. Table 2.2 lists some of the factors that can influence a
person’s perceptions and views about health concerns.

Risk analysis and risk management play an important role in public policy. These debates
range from the development of environmental impact statements for the location of
buildings to debates on household lead abatement and what chemicals can be allowed in
the food supply. Quality of life issues such as asthma and or loss of mental function are
now recognized as important components of risk assessment. For example, childhood
exposure to lead can result in reduced IQ, which can affect an individual throughout their
lifetime. Similarly, childhood asthma can have a severe impact on an individual’s ability
to play and socialize.
In the past, much of the formal risk assessment concerned an estimation of the risk of
cancer and subsequent death and then deciding what was acceptable. Typically, a risk of
death of less than | in 100,000 (10°) or 1 in 1 million (10°) is considered an “acceptable”
level of risk for exposure to a chemical. In comparison, the risk of death in an automobile
accident is 1 in 4000 and the risk of death from lightning 1s | in 2 million. Comparisons
like those above are sometimes used to argue that the risk of exposure to a chemical agent
is negligible. Such comparisons can be misleading, however, if the conditions of the two
risks are different. For example, if they affect different populations unequally, say falling
disproportionately on those of a particular ethnic background, the risks may be more
likely to be judged unacceptable. Or if one risk is the result of voluntary choice (drinking
alcohol) and another is not (eating food contaminated with bacteria), it cannot be
assumed that an individual will be equally willing to tolerate them.

Risk assessment is a complex area that requires the application of all the principles of
toxicology. It is often divided into four somewhat overlapping areas 1) hazard
identification, 2) dose-response assessment, 3) exposure assessment, and 4) risk
characterization. Hazard identification is the process of collecting and evaluating
information on the effects of an agent on animal or human health and well-being. In most
cases, this involves a careful assessment of the adverse effects and what is the most
sensitive population. The dose-response assessment involves evaluation of the
relationship between dose and adverse effect. Typically, an effort 1s made to determine
the lowest dose or exposure at which an effect is observed. A comparison is often made
between animal data and any human data that might be available. Next is exposure
assessment, in which an evaluation of the likely exposure to any given population is
assessed. Important parameters include the dose, duration, frequency, and route of
exposure. The final step is risk characterization, in which all the above information is
synthesized and a judgment made on what is an acceptable level of human exposure. In
the simplest terms, risk is the product of two factors: hazard and exposure (i.e. hazard x
exposure = risk). In real risk assessments, all hazards may not be known and exposure is
often difficult to quantify precisely. As a result, the calculated risk may not accurately
reflect the real risk. The accuracy of a risk assessment is no better than the data and
assumptions upon which it is based.
Risk management 1s the political or social process of deciding how the benefits balance
the associated risks. Risk management is also concerned with how the public perceives
risk and how we judge and perform our own risk assessments. An example of risk
management was the decision to remove lead from gasoline. After a great deal of
research, it was demonstrated that low levels of lead exposure are harmful to the
developing nervous system. It was then determined that this benefits of removing lead
from gasoline was greater than the costs. A program was then developed to gradually
phase out lead from gasoline in line with the engines of new cars not requiring lead and
the replacement of old cars.
Summary
The principles of toxicology are summarized in as follows: dose / response, risk=
hazard X exposure and individual sensitivity. Many of us have an excellent intuitive
sense of the principles of toxicology from experience with caffeine, alcohol, or other drug
exposures. These experiences form a foundation upon which to build a formal
understanding of toxicology that is applicable to many situations. We make many
personal decisions based on dose/response and risk consideration. Around our home, we
must decide which cleaning products to use or whether to apply pesticides to our lawn or
garden. As citizens, we are also confronted with many broader concerns about
environmental exposures. How much do we invest to limit the spread of environmental
contaminants? Should coal-fired power generating facilities be required to invest in more
sophisticated smoke stack scrubbers to remove mercury? On what basis do we make this

decision? Advances in the toxicological sciences along with general advances in the

biological sciences provide new knowledge and understanding upon which to make these

and other decisions. And finally, I hope that beyond the principles of toxicology that you

will find that toxicology is both fun and informative.
