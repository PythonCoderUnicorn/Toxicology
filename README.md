# Intro to Toxicology

> Dr. Jake Stout, Department of Biological Science, _University of Manitoba_, 2015.

A survey of general principles underlying the effects of toxic substances on biological systems, including consideration of the history, scope and applications of toxicology, toxicant exposure, the mechanisms of toxic action, and some major types of toxicants.
