    "text": "Toxicology is the study of how natural or man-made poisons cause undesirable effects in living organisms.\n\n\nHarmful or adverse effects are those that are damaging to either the survival or normal function of the individual.\n\n\n\nThe word “toxicity” describes the degree to which a substance is poisonous or can cause injury. The toxicity depends on a variety of factors: dose, duration and route of exposure, shape and structure of the chemical itself, and individual human factors.\n\n\n\nThis term relates to poisonous or deadly effects on:\n\nthe body by inhalation (breathing)\ningestion (eating)\nabsorption\nby direct contact with a chemical.\n\n\n\n\nA toxicant is any chemical that can injure or kill humans, animals, or plants; a poison.\nThe term “toxicant” is used when talking about toxic substances that are produced by or are a by-product of human-made activities.\nExamples include dioxin and arsenic, both are toxicants\n\n\n\nThe term “toxin” usually is used when talking about toxic substances produced naturally.\nA toxin is any poisonous substance of:\n\nmicrobial (bacteria or other tiny plants or animals) or\nvegetable or\nsynthetic chemical origin that reacts with specific cellular components to kill cells, alter growth or development, or kill the organism.\n\nA Toxic Symptom includes any feeling or sign indicating the presence of a poison in the system\nToxic Effects This term refers to the health effects that occur due to exposure to a toxic substance; also known as a poisonous effect on the body.\nSelective Toxicity a chemical will produce injury to one kind of living matter without harming another form of life, even though the two may exist close together.\n\n\n\nBefore toxicity can develop, a substance must come into contact with a body surface such as skin, eye or mucosa of the digestive or respiratory tract. The dose of the chemical, or the amount one comes into contact with, is important when discussing how “toxic” an substance can be.\nWhat is a dose\nThe dose is the actual amount of a chemical that enters the body. The dose received may be due to either acute (short) or chronic (long-term) exposure. An acute exposure occurs over a very short period of time, usually 24 hours. Chronic exposures occur over long periods of time such as weeks, months, or years. The amount of exposure and the type of toxin will determine the toxic effect.\nWhat is dose-response?\nDose-response is a relationship between exposure and health effect, that can be established by measuring the response relative to an increasing dose. This relationship 1s important in determining the toxicity of a particular substance (2). It relies on the concept that a dose, or a time of exposure (to a chemical, drug, or toxic substance), will cause an effect (response) on the exposed organism. Usually, the larger or more intense the dose, the greater the response, or the effect. This is the meaning behind the statement “the dose makes the poison.”\nWhat is the threshold dose?\nGiven the idea of a dose-response, there should be a dose or exposure level below which the harmful or adverse effects of a substance are not seen in a population. That dose is referred to as the ‘threshold dose’. This dose 1s also referred to as the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL), or the no effect level (NEL). These terms are often used by toxicologists when discussing the relationship between exposure and dose.\nFor substances causing cancer (carcinogens) no safe level of exposure exists, since any exposure could result in cancer.\nWhat is ‘individual susceptibility?’\nThis term describes the differences in types of responses to hazardous substances, between people. Each person is unique, and because of that, there may be great differences in the response to exposure. Exposure in one person may have no effect, while a second person may become seriously ill, and a third may develop cancer.\nWhat is “sensitive sub-population?”\nA sensitive sub-population describes those persons who are more at risk from illness due to exposure to hazardous substances than the average, healthy person.\nThese persons usually include:\n\nthe very young\nthe chronically ill\nthe very old.\npregnant women and women of childbearing age.\n\nDepending on the type of contaminant, other factors (e.g., age, weight, lifestyle, sex) could be used to describe the population."

For example, breathing too much pure oxygen, drinking excessive amounts of water, or eating too much salt can cause poisoning or death\n\n1.1.1 Electronic Databases\nInformation on toxic chemicals is available at the following sites:\n\nTOXNET Toxicology Data Network. Several databases, such as:\n\nthe Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB)\nRegistry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS) contains information on the health effects for more than 90,000 chemicals.\nThe HSDB has toxicological information on more than 4,000 chemicals, as well as information on emergency handling procedures, environmental data, regulatory status, and human exposure.\n\nCHEMTREC (Chemical Transportation Emergency Center). CHEMTREC is provided by the American Chemistry Council and provides information and assistance for emergency incidents involving chemicals and hazardous materials.\nMSDS Material Safety Data Sheets are available on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration website. MSDS provide information such as physical and chemical properties of a substance, first aid information, emergency response, and disposal information.\nHazDat Hazardous Substances and Health Effects Database, contains information on hazardous substances found at National Priorities List (NPL) and non-NPL waste sites and emergency events, and on the levels at which health effects from exposure to hazardous substances have been reported in humans and animals. HAZDAT contains environmental contamination and other data on more than 3,000 uncontrolled hazardous waste sites."

    "text": "There are three basic and interwoven principles of toxicology:\nWhile these principles may form much of the foundation of toxicology, when it comes to any specific substance there is likely to be controversy. Disagreement may arise on the relative importance of any one of these principles while trying to evaluate implications for public health. Exploring these principles is an essential first step before examining their application to any specific substance."
