    "text": "Toxicology is the study of how natural or man-made poisons cause undesirable effects in living organisms.\n\n\nHarmful or adverse effects are those that are damaging to either the survival or normal function of the individual.\n\n\n\nThe word “toxicity” describes the degree to which a substance is poisonous or can cause injury. The toxicity depends on a variety of factors: dose, duration and route of exposure, shape and structure of the chemical itself, and individual human factors.\n\n\n\nThis term relates to poisonous or deadly effects on:\n\nthe body by inhalation (breathing)\ningestion (eating)\nabsorption\nby direct contact with a chemical.\n\n\n\n\nA toxicant is any chemical that can injure or kill humans, animals, or plants; a poison.\nThe term “toxicant” is used when talking about toxic substances that are produced by or are a by-product of human-made activities.\nExamples include dioxin and arsenic, both are toxicants\n\n\n\nThe term “toxin” usually is used when talking about toxic substances produced naturally.\nA toxin is any poisonous substance of:\n\nmicrobial (bacteria or other tiny plants or animals) or\nvegetable or\nsynthetic chemical origin that reacts with specific cellular components to kill cells, alter growth or development, or kill the organism.\n\nA Toxic Symptom includes any feeling or sign indicating the presence of a poison in the system\nToxic Effects This term refers to the health effects that occur due to exposure to a toxic substance; also known as a poisonous effect on the body.\nSelective Toxicity a chemical will produce injury to one kind of living matter without harming another form of life, even though the two may exist close together.\n\n\n\nBefore toxicity can develop, a substance must come into contact with a body surface such as skin, eye or mucosa of the digestive or respiratory tract. The dose of the chemical, or the amount one comes into contact with, is important when discussing how “toxic” an substance can be.\nWhat is a dose\nThe dose is the actual amount of a chemical that enters the body. The dose received may be due to either acute (short) or chronic (long-term) exposure. An acute exposure occurs over a very short period of time, usually 24 hours. Chronic exposures occur over long periods of time such as weeks, months, or years. The amount of exposure and the type of toxin will determine the toxic effect.\nWhat is dose-response?\nDose-response is a relationship between exposure and health effect, that can be established by measuring the response relative to an increasing dose. This relationship 1s important in determining the toxicity of a particular substance (2). It relies on the concept that a dose, or a time of exposure (to a chemical, drug, or toxic substance), will cause an effect (response) on the exposed organism. Usually, the larger or more intense the dose, the greater the response, or the effect. This is the meaning behind the statement “the dose makes the poison.”\nWhat is the threshold dose?\nGiven the idea of a dose-response, there should be a dose or exposure level below which the harmful or adverse effects of a substance are not seen in a population. That dose is referred to as the ‘threshold dose’. This dose 1s also referred to as the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL), or the no effect level (NEL). These terms are often used by toxicologists when discussing the relationship between exposure and dose.\nFor substances causing cancer (carcinogens) no safe level of exposure exists, since any exposure could result in cancer.\nWhat is ‘individual susceptibility?’\nThis term describes the differences in types of responses to hazardous substances, between people. Each person is unique, and because of that, there may be great differences in the response to exposure. Exposure in one person may have no effect, while a second person may become seriously ill, and a third may develop cancer.\nWhat is “sensitive sub-population?”\nA sensitive sub-population describes those persons who are more at risk from illness due to exposure to hazardous substances than the average, healthy person.\nThese persons usually include:\n\nthe very young\nthe chronically ill\nthe very old.\npregnant women and women of childbearing age.\n\nDepending on the type of contaminant, other factors (e.g., age, weight, lifestyle, sex) could be used to describe the population."

For a chemical agent or drug the dose is the amount of the material in relation to body weight. Typically, the amount of material is measured in grams or thousandths of a gram (milligrams, mg) and body weight is measured in kilograms (kg), equal to one thousand grams. The dose is the amount of material consumed divided by body weight or mg/kg.\nCalculate the dose\namt_mg = amount of material consumed (mg)\nwt_kg = body weight in (kg)\n\noral_dose = amt_mg / wt_kg\n\n2.1.1 Coffee Caffeine Example\nThere are approximately 100 mg of caffeine in a cup of coffee. The actual amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee depends on the coffee bean, how the coffee was prepared and the size of the cup. Let us use an adult weighing 155 lbs (about 70 kg) consuming this one-cup of coffee.\n\n# kg = lbs / 2.205\n\namt_mg = 100\nwt_kg =  70.30\n\noral_dose = function(amt_mg, wt_kg){\n  dose = amt_mg / wt_kg\n  glue::glue(\"Oral Dose = {round(dose,2)} mg/kg\")\n}\n\noral_dose(amt_mg, wt_kg)\n\nOral Dose = 1.42 mg/kg\n\n\nThis adult would receive a dose of 1.42 mg/kg of caffeine.\n\n\n2.1.2 Difficulties with dose calculations\nFor our example of coffee caffeine:\n\ndetermining the exact amount of exposure to the agent\namount of caffeine in a cup of coffee varies\nthe coffee bean type\nbrewing method\nsize of the cup\n\nAnalytical chemists can accurately determine the amount of a specific agent in a material. Some foods, such as table salt or sugar, are relatively pure and the dose easily calculated by weighing the material. Package labeling usually indicates how many milligrams of the drug each pill contains, so the dose can be calculated.\nCalculating the dose following workplace or environmental exposure can be far more difficult. If the agent is in the air, then calculation of the dose must consider not only the concentration in the air but also the duration of the exposure, rate of breathing and body weight. The amount of air inhaled over a period of time is estimated from laboratory data. Given this information, it is possible to estimate the dose according to the following formula:\nAirborne agent\ninhal_dose    = Inhalation dose (mg/kg)\nair_concent   = Air concentration of agent (mg/ml)\nvol_air       = volume of air inhaled per hour (ml/hr)\ndur_expos     = duration of exposure (hr)\nb_wt          = body weight (kg)\n\ninhal_dose = air_concent * vol_air * dur_expos / b_wt\nFor non-chemical exposures, other variables and different units of measurement are required. Workplace and environmental exposures are often repeated and ongoing over an extended period of time. The health effects of repeated long-term exposures can be very different from one short-term exposure.\n\n\n2.1.3 Acute vs Chronic\nFor many drugs, we are looking for the immediate or acute response following exposure. We consume common painkillers with the desire to quickly stop our headache. Long-term repeated use, however, can have undesirable effects on the stomach or liver.\n\nAcute exposure - is a single or very limited number of exposures over a short period of time.\nChronic exposure is repeated exposure over a long period of time.\n\nThere is often a range of responses associated with any particular agent.\n\nThe response that occurs will vary with the dose\nthe duration of exposure\nthe individual\n\nThe acute response to a single dose is often the easiest to characterize, but the response to multiple exposures over a long period of time may be the most important. For a long time, it was thought that the only serious complication from childhood lead exposure was death resulting from high exposure. Subsequent research demonstrated that even small amounts of lead exposure during childhood could result in brain damage that lasts a lifetime. Determining what responses are most important is a central aspect of many debates in toxicology."

    "text": "2.2 Demonstrating Dose Response\nIn general, it is true that for any individual, the greater the dose the greater the response. It is important to know if a substance distributes into body water because we made up of approximately 75% water. An individual’s response to the caffeine varies with the dose and corresponding amount of circulating caffeine. Body size is a critical factor in determining dose and any subsequent response.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot illustrates the critical relationship between dose and response. In this case, we define the response as difficulty in walking and the dose of or exposure to alcohol as a glass of wine. To change from exposure to dose we would need to know the body weight and amount of alcohol in the glass of wine.\nIn toxicology, the dose at which one half or 50% of the population is affected is often calculated and used to compare the toxicity of different agents. In this example, 50% of the population is affected after exposure to 4.5 glasses of wine.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor doses less than 30 mg/kg have no effect and doses above 50 mg/kg effect half the people. The “S”’-shaped idealized dose / response plot, which is typical of most types of exposure. This “S” shaped cure illustrates that at low doses there is little or no response while at high doses all individuals respond or demonstrate the effect. In this situation, 50% of the subjects respond at a dose of 42 mg/kg, while 99% of the subjects responded at 90 mg/kg.\nIt is important to emphasize that if we repeat this experiment the results would be slightly different. Each individual varies from one time to the next and there is even greater variability between individuals. Variability is a consistent theme in biology, complicating data analysis and interpretation of results. These variations lead to the need for statistical evaluation of data."
